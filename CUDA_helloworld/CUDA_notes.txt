some CUDA notes

NVIDIA releases "CUDA toolkit" and an optional "CUDA SDK".

https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
https://developer.nvidia.com/gpu-computing-sdk

toolkit is everything you need to run stuff with CUDA. SDK is optional and provides some useful stuff.

there are some development tools like CUDA-GDB command line debugger and CUDA-MEMCHECK analyzer, which may be useful in the project.
